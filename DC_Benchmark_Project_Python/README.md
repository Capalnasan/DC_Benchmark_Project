3. Click any benchmark button to run the test and see real-time progress and results.

## Structure

Each lab is in its own folder with its main Python script.
No external dependencies except standard Python and `numpy`.

## Benchmarks included

- CPU Benchmark
- RAM/Cache Benchmark
- Pi Calculation
